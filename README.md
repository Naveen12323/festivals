	X-mas is a common abbreviation of the word Christmas. The "-mas" part is from the Latin-derived Old English word for Mass,while the "X" comes from the Greek letter Chi, which is the first letter of the Greek word which comes into English as "Christ". There is a common misconception that the word X-mas stems from a secular attempt to	remove the religious tradition from Christmas by taking the "Christ" out of "Christmas",but its use dates back to the 16th century.
